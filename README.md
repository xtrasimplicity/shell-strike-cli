Shell Strike
===========

A simple ruby application intended to simplify the discovery of valid credentials for one or more SSH servers running on traditional (22) or non-standard ports, using a user-defined dictionary of usernames and passwords.

This application is intended to be used for educational purposes, and was written to assist with quickly identifying credential combinations for poorly documented internal servers. This application is intended to be used against servers that you are authorised to 'attack' and the developer takes no responsibility for any issues which may arise due to misuse of this application.
